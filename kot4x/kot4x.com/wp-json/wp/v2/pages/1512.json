Trading in margined account involves a high degree of risk including the risk of loss of the Customer\u2019s entire Risk Capital deposited WITH US4X. Losses, in some cases, have the potential to extend beyond the Customer\u2019s Account Value. In consideration of Paramount Treasury Investmentagreeing to enter into contracts with its Customer(s) for this Account, Paramount Treasury Investmentrequires all the undersigned Customer(s) to analyze their financial objectives, financial status, investment constraints, and tax situation to determine whether trading is suitable. In addition, we require our Customers to carefully read and acknowledge the Paramount Treasury InvestmentRisk Disclosure Statement that outlines without limitation the risks associated with trading a margined account through KOT4X.<\/p>\n<p>By signing this Agreement the Customer understands and agrees that:<\/p>\n<p>70. OTC Margined Trading involves a high amount of risk and is highly speculative. Customer(s) agrees that they are in full understanding and willing to assume the legal, economic, and other risks associated with the trading a margined account, and are willing and able to assume the loss of their entire Risk Capital, defined as those funds, that if lost, would not change your lifestyle or your family\u2019s lifestyle. As such, they further agree that margined trading is not suitable for Retirement Funds. Paramount Treasury Investmentencourages Customers to closely manage outstanding open positions and to use prudent money management precautions such as, but not limited to, Stop Loss Orders.<\/p>\n<p>71. Excessive leverage available with Margined accounts can lead to quick losses. Customer(s) agrees that using a high degree of leverage, defined as the use of a small amount of capital to control a larger amount of an Open Position, can result in large losses due to a price change(s) of open contract(s) WITH US4X. Paramount Treasury Investmentprovides leverage on most trading products for most customers of 100:1 or more. With 100:1 leverage the Customer has the potential to control $1,000,000 position with $10,000 in an Account. Paramount Treasury Investmentencourages its Customers to use only that portion of leverage that the Customer is most comfortable with and to use money management precautions such as, but not limited to, Stop Loss Orders for the purpose of limiting risk. Paramount Treasury Investmentreserves, at its sole discretion, the right to reduce or increase the amount of leverage given on any trading product at any time and without notice.<\/p>\n<p>72. Trading experience periods of liquidity risk. Customer acknowledges that Liquidity Risk, resulting from decreased liquidity, is usually due to unanticipated changes in economic and\/or political conditions. The customer also acknowledges that Liquidity Risk can affect the general market in that all participants experience the same lack of buyers and\/or sellers. The Customer also understands that liquidity risk can be Paramount Treasury Investmentspecific due to changes in liquidity available to Paramount Treasury Investmentfrom a Paramount Treasury InvestmentCustodian of funds interbank liquidity providers due to a perception that the risks of the market segment have increased. When liquidity decreases, Customers can expect, at the minimum, to have wider bid to ask spreads as the supply of available bid\/ask prices, outstrips the demand. Decreases in liquidity can also result in \u201cFast Market\u201d conditions where the price of a trading product moves sharply higher or lower or in a volatile up\/down pattern without trading in an ordinary step\u00ad like fashion. In some instances, there may exist the possibility that a trading bid and\/or ask price for a trading product or products are not available (a situation where there is no liquidity). Although there may be instances when the aggregate OTC market enters a \u201cFast Market\u201d situation or periods where liquidity is in short or no supply, it is important to note that prices, bid\/ask spreads and liquidity will reflect the prevailing interbank market liquidity for KOT4X. Paramount Treasury Investmentcan Liquidate Positions of the Customer that do not have adequate margin: Because of the leverage available with OTC Margined Trading and the potential for extreme volatility, Paramount Treasury InvestmentCustodian of funds reserves the sole discretionary right to liquidate Customer\u2019s Account(s) should the Margin in the Account not be sufficient to cover the potential risk of loss. Should the Customer\u2019s Account value go below the free of programming bugs that can cause trading, position keeping or any other required functionality of the Trading Platform and other relevant software applications associated with Paramount Treasury Investmentincluding but limited to clearing and escrow Account software, from becoming inoperable or without errors?<\/p>\n<p>73. There is a Communication Risk that the Customer assumes. Although Paramount Treasury Investmentwill have qualified representatives available on the telephone during business hours to accept and execute Customer Market Orders, there exists the risk that the Customer will not be able to contact or make contact with the Paramount Treasury Investmentrepresentative due to but not limited to, communication malfunction, an overabundance of telephone orders, or any other malfunction or negligence. The Customer acknowledges and agrees that they will hold harmless Paramount Treasury Investmentfor any loss or missed trading opportunity resulting from any communication problems the Customer may encounter.<\/p>\n<p>74. Paramount Treasury Investmentdoes not take responsibility for Money Managers. Should a Customer grant a Money Manager trading discretionary trading authority or control over a Customer\u2019s Account, the Customer acknowledges that Paramount Treasury Investmentdoes not take any responsibility for any action done by that Third Party on the Customer\u2019s behalf. The Customer grants Money Manager trading authority for the Customer\u2019s Account at its sole, and full risk. Paramount Treasury Investmentreserves the right to correct any transactions executed on misquoting errors: In the case when a quoting error occurs that results in a Customer transaction done at an off-market price, Paramount Treasury Investmentreserves the sole discretionary right to make the necessary corrections and adjustments to the Customer\u2019s Account whether it be in the favor of the Customer or not in the Customer\u2019s favor. Any change will be reported to the Customer either verbally or via an electronic method such as but not limited to email.<\/p>\n<p>75. All Market Recommendations made by Paramount Treasury Investmentor any representative of Paramount Treasury Investmentare for informational purposes only. Any decision by the Customer to buy or sell is an independent decision by the Customer. Market recommendations made by Paramount Treasury Investmentor a representative of Paramount Treasury Investmentdo not constitute an offer to sell or buy from Paramount Treasury Investmentor from any other source that may provide straight\u00adthrough-processing prices to the Customer. Paramount Treasury Investmentand its employees are not investment advisor(s) and have no fiduciary duty to Customer and therefore are not liable for any losses incurred by the Customer as a result of information or any recommendations made by Paramount Treasury Investmentor representative of KOT4X. The customer is at Risk if Paramount Treasury Investmentshould go out of business. There is no guarantee that Paramount Treasury Investmentas a business will be profitable. Consequently, there exists a credit risk that Paramount Treasury Investmentmay be subject to losses, which could, in turn, jeopardize the capital that the Customers have in their Accounts. Customer acknowledges that in the event of insolvency, the Customer can only look to Paramount Treasury Investmentfor performance and return of all Collateral and Margin that the Customer may have at KOT4X.<\/p>\n<p>76. KOT4Xmay decide to exit the Business. There is no guarantee that Paramount Treasury InvestmentCustodian of funds may decide that they do not want to continue to participate. As a result, the Customer agrees and acknowledges that Paramount Treasury Investmentmay liquidate all Customer positions, and return margined funds to the Customer at the sole discretion of KOT4X, at any time and for any reason. Paramount Treasury InvestmentCustomers do not hold Paramount Treasury Investmentliable for any loss as a result of the liquidation of the Customers position either on an actual basis or as a result of missed profit opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>77. Customers are responsible for any reporting errors. Any reporting and confirmation errors of omission, and\/or errors in the details of transactions including but not limited to the price contracts were executed, the product traded, the market direction (i.e., \u201dbuy\u201d or \u201csell\u201d) of order, the type of order and\/or any errors in fees, charges or credits to the Customer\u2019s Account including but not limited to charges for executing a transaction, wiring funds, rolling over position, and sweeping balances into the home currency, require that the customer notifies Paramount Treasury Investmentimmediately upon discovery for review.<\/p>\n<p>78. Risks from trades done over the telephone. Paramount Treasury Investmentwill only accept Market Orders for trades done over the telephone. Telephone trades are considered executed when the Paramount Treasury Investmentrepresentative says, \u201cdone\u201d and relays the complete transaction details. Any given price by a Paramount Treasury Investmentrepresentative over the telephone prior to execution is considered indicative. Paramount Treasury Investmentreserves the right to change the indicative price given over the phone if the actual trading price is different due to market conditions, misquote or volatility. Paramount Treasury Investmentis not responsible for Customer telephone orders if the Customer cannot be heard or understood by the Paramount Treasury Investmentrepresentative due to, without limitation, accent, speech defect, faulty connection, or excessive background noise at the Customers location or at KOT4X. To better ensure execution, Paramount Treasury Investmentrequires that Customers communicate in English when giving orders. Paramount Treasury Investmentcannot guarantee that telephone orders given in a foreign language will be executed. For best results and fast execution, the following procedure will be used:<\/p>\n<p>a. The Customer will first be asked by the Paramount Treasury Investmentrepresentative the following Account Information:<\/p>\n<p>b. The Customer\u2019s Paramount Treasury InvestmentUser Name, Account Number and\/or other identifying feature. Only after the Paramount Treasury Investmentrepresentative confirms the Customer\u2019s identity, the Customer should relay the following order information:<\/p>\n<p>c. The execution direction to Buy or Sell, the number of lots, and the desired trading product.<\/p>\n<p>d. The Paramount Treasury Investmentrepresentative will then repeat the order information for the Customer to confirm. For example, the Paramount Treasury InvestmentRepresentative may say the following, \u201cBuy 2 lots of EUR vs USD at the Market. Confirmed?\u201d By saying, \u201cYes\u201d the order will be executed at the Market and the details immediately given to the Customer after execution. The Paramount Treasury Investmentrepresentative will enter the transaction into the Customer\u2019s Account. The details and effects of the transaction will be reflected in the Customer\u2019s Online Reports. Paramount Treasury Investmentdoes not warrant that trades done over the telephone will be done at prices that mirror the prices displayed electronically at that time over the Trading Platform. Paramount Treasury Investmentreserves the right to charge a commission for trades done over the telephone. Should Paramount Treasury Investmentcharge a commission for telephone trades, it will be reported on the Paramount Treasury InvestmentWebsite and be reflected as a line item debit in your Paramount Treasury InvestmentAccount Reports. All trades and charges done via the phone are final. Paramount Treasury Investmentreserves the right to tape all telephone calls without knowledge of the Customer. Paramount Treasury Investmentis not responsible or liable if the tapes of the telephone calls are erased or never recorded because of error, omission or any reason. Paramount Treasury Investmentis also not liable should User Name and Account information be obtained knowingly or unknowingly by a Third Party and as a result, trades done in the name of the Customer without his or her knowledge or authorization.<\/p>\n<p>79. Risks from trades done using chat communication devices. Paramount Treasury Investmentmay utilize an electronic conversational application or other similar chat application for the communication and execution of some market orders. Trades are done using chat applications or the telephone should only be done if the Customer cannot execute using the Trading Platform. Although currently not planned, Paramount Treasury Investmentreserves the right to charge a commission for trades done over chat applications. Should Paramount Treasury Investmentcharge a commission for chat application trades, it will be reported on the Paramount Treasury InvestmentWebsite and be reflected as a line item debit in your Paramount Treasury InvestmentAccount Reports. All trades and charges done via chat applications are final. Neither Paramount Treasury Investmentnor third-party chats application provider is responsible or liable if the electronic logs of the electronic conversations are erased or never recorded because of error, omission or any reason. Paramount Treasury Investmentis also not liable should User Name, Password and Account information be obtained knowingly or unknowingly by a Third Party and as a result, trades done in the name of the Customer without his or her knowledge or authorization.<\/p>\n<p>80. Paramount Treasury Investmenthas limited liability. The Customer agrees and acknowledges that Paramount Treasury Investmentshall not be liable to the Customer for any claims, losses, damages, costs or expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees caused directly or indirectly by any events, actions or omissions, without limitation, claims, losses, damages, costs and expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, resulting from civil unrest, war, insurrection, international intervention, governmental action) including, without limits, exchange controls, forfeitures, devaluations and nationalizations), natural disasters, acts of God, market conditions, communication problems or any delay, disruption, failure of any transmission or communication system or computer hardware or software application whether supplied and belonging to Paramount Treasury Investmentor from a third party vendor that the Customer and Paramount Treasury Investmentrelies on to conduct execution and reporting services.<\/p>\n<p>81. Effect of \u201cLeverage\u201d or \u201cGearing\u201d. Margin accounts and contracts carry a high degree of risk. The amount of initial margin is small relative to the value of the contract so that transactions are \u201cleveraged\u201d or \u201cgeared\u201d. A relatively small market movement may have a proportionately larger impact on the funds the customer has deposited or will have to deposit. This may work against Customer as well as for Customer. Customer may sustain a total loss of initial margin funds and any additional funds deposited with the firm to maintain Customer\u2019s position.<\/p>\n<p>82. Risk-reducing orders or strategies. Placing contingent orders, such as \u201cstop\u00adloss\u201d or \u201climit\u201d orders, particularly in volatile market conditions, will not necessarily limit Customer\u2019s losses to the intended amounts, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders. Strategies using combinations of positions, such as \u201cspread\u201d and \u201cstraddle\u201d positions may be as risky as taking simple \u201clong\u201d or \u201cshort\u201d positions.<\/p>\n<p>83. Before Customer begins to trade, Customer should obtain a clear understanding of all charges for which Customer may be liable. These charges will affect Customer\u2019s net profit (if any) or increase Customer\u2019s loss.<\/p>\n<p>84. Electronic trading. Trading on an electronic trading system may differ not only from trading in an open outcry market but also from trading on other electronic trading systems. If Customer undertakes transactions on an electronic trading system, Customer will be exposed to risks associated with the system including any failure of hardware and software. The result of any system failure may be that Customer\u2019s order is either not executed according to Customer\u2019s instructions or not executed at all. Since Paramount Treasury Investmentdoes not control signal power, it&#8217;s a reception or routing via Internet, the configuration of Customer\u2019s equipment or reliability of its connection, Paramount Treasury Investmentcannot be responsible for communication failures, distortions or delays when trading online (via the Internet). In no event shall Paramount Treasury Investmentbe liable for speculative or expectancy damages for potential future lost profits.<\/p>\n<p>85. Limitation of liability. Customer accepts any trading system provided by Paramount Treasury Investment\u201cas is,\u201d and without warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use, purpose or application; timeliness; freedom from interruption; or any implied warranties arising from trade usage, course of trading or course of performance. Under no circumstances shall Paramount Treasury Investmentbe liable for any punitive, indirect, incidental, special or consequential loss or damages, including loss of business, profits or goodwill. Paramount Treasury Investmentshall not be liable to Customer by reason of delays or interruptions of service or transmissions, or failures of performance of KOT4X\u2019s or its affiliate systems, regardless of cause, including, but not limited to, those caused by hardware or software malfunction; regulatory action; acts of God; war, terrorism, or our intentional acts. Customer recognizes that there may be delays or interruptions in the use of our system, including, for example, those caused intentionally by Paramount Treasury Investmentfor purposes of servicing the system. Paramount Treasury Investmentdoes not guarantee that alternative trading arrangements will be available at a particular time and Paramount Treasury Investmentwill not be held liable for delays in entering an order.<\/p>\n<p>86. KOT4X\u2019S margin policies require that Customer\u2019s Account is properly margined at all times. Failure to meet margin requirements may result in the liquidation of any open positions with a resultant loss. Paramount Treasury Investmentreserves the right to liquidate all positions without notice if an Account falls below Customer\u2019s minimum margin requirement, in accordance WITH US4X\u2019s margin call policy.<\/p>\n<p>87. Quoting errors. Should quoting errors occur, which may include, but are not limited to, a mistype of a quote by KOT4X, a quote which is not representative of fair market prices, an erroneous price quote from a Paramount Treasury Investmentemployee, such as but not limited to a wrong big figure quote or an erroneous quote due to failure of hardware, software or communication lines or systems and\/or inaccurate external data feeds provided by third\u00adparty vendors, Paramount Treasury Investmentwill not be liable for the resulting errors in Account balances. The foregoing list is not meant to be exhaustive and in the event of a quoting error, Paramount Treasury Investmentreserves the right to make the necessary corrections or adjustments on the Account involved. Any dispute arising from such quoting errors will be resolved in accordance with required regulations if such regulations exist. In the event of a system error where interest is not charged or credited as scheduled, Paramount Treasury Investmentreserves the right to apply the missed interest to the Account at any time.<\/p>\n<p>88. Third-Party Authority. In the event that Customer grants trading authority or control over Customer\u2019s Account to a third-party trading advisor, such as a Money Manager, whether on a discretionary or non\u00ad discretionary basis, Paramount Treasury Investmentshall in no way be responsible for reviewing Customer\u2019s choice of such trading advisor, or for making any recommendations with respect thereto. Paramount Treasury Investmentmakes no representations or warranties concerning any trading advisor; Paramount Treasury Investmentshall not be responsible for any loss to Customer occasioned by the actions of the trading advisor; and Paramount Treasury Investmentdoes not, by implication or otherwise, endorse or approve of the operating methods of any trading advisor. If Customer gives a Money Manager authority to exercise any rights over Customer\u2019s Account, Customer does so at Customer\u2019s own risk. The customer should regularly review the activity in Customer\u2019s Account to ensure that Customer approves of the transactions placed on Customer\u2019s behalf by Customer\u2019s Money Manager.<\/p>\n<p>89. Disclosure Regarding Bankruptcy Protections. The transactions Customer is entering into with Paramount Treasury Investmentare not traded on an exchange. Therefore, Customer\u2019s funds may not receive the same protections as funds used to margin or guarantee exchange\u00adtraded futures and options contracts, which may receive a priority in bankruptcy. Since that same priority has not been given to funds used for trading, if Paramount Treasury Investmentbecomes insolvent and Customer has a claim for amounts deposited or profits earned on transactions WITH US4X, Customer\u2019s claim may not receive a priority. Without a priority, Customer is a general creditor and Customer\u2019s claim will be paid, along with the claims of other general creditors, from any monies still available after priority claims are paid. Even customer funds that Paramount Treasury Investmentkeeps separate from its own operating funds may not be safe from the claims of other general and priority creditors.<\/p>\n<p>90. Volatile Market Conditions. Trading at times of extraordinarily volatile market conditions, e.g. key news announcements may expose the Customer to additional risks, including the risk that the Customer may not get the price him or her requests. Paramount Treasury Investmentcannot and does not guarantee its prices in times of extraordinary market volatility.<\/p>\n<p>91. Simulated Conditions. Simulated conditions may differ from real conditions. Therefore, Customers who trade on demo Accounts should not necessarily expect the same results from live trading.<\/p>\n<p>92. Referring Parties. IF YOU WERE REFERRED TO Paramount Treasury InvestmentBY AN INTRODUCING BROKER, REFERRING PARTY OR THIRD PARTY ADVISOR (EACH, AN \u201cIB\u201d), PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT Paramount Treasury InvestmentAND YOUR IB ARE WHOLLY SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT FROM ONE ANOTHER AND THERE EXISTS NO JOINT VENTURE OR PARTNERSHIP RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES. ADDITIONALLY, NEITHER IB NOR ANY OTHER EMPLOYEE OR AGENT OF IB IS AN AGENT OR EMPLOYEE OF KOT4X.<\/p>\n<p>93. Paramount Treasury Investmentdoes not control, and cannot endorse or vouch for the accuracy or completeness of any information or advice Customer may have received or may receive in the future from Customer\u2019s IB or from any other person not employed by Paramount Treasury Investmentregarding trading or the risks involved in such trading.<\/p>\n<p>94. Paramount Treasury Investmentprovides risk disclosure information to all new Customers when they open Accounts. The customer should read that information carefully, and should not rely on any information to the contrary from any other source.<\/p>\n<p>95. Customer acknowledges that no promises have been made by Paramount Treasury Investmentor any individual associated with Paramount Treasury Investmentregarding future profits or losses in Customer\u2019s Account. Customer understands that trading is very risky and that many people lose money trading.<\/p>\n<p>96. If an IB or any other third party provides Customer with information or advice regarding trading, Paramount Treasury Investmentshall in no way be responsible for any loss to Customer resulting from Customer\u2019s use of such information or advice.<\/p>\n<p>97. To the extent Customer has previously been led to believe or believes that utilizing any third party trading system, course, program, research or recommendations provided by IB or any other third party will result in trading profits, Customer hereby acknowledges, agrees and understands that all trading, including trading done pursuant to a system, course, program, research or recommendations of IB or another third party involves a substantial risk of loss. In addition, Customer hereby acknowledges, agrees and understands that the use of a trading system, course, program, research or recommendations of IB or another third party will not necessarily result in profits, or will avoid losses or limit losses.<\/p>\n<p>98. Because the risk factor is high in trading, only genuine risk capital should be used. If Customer does not have capital which the Customer can afford to lose, Customer should not trade.<\/p>\n<p>99. Customer understands and acknowledges that Paramount Treasury Investmentmay compensate Customer\u2019s IB for introducing Customer to Paramount Treasury Investmentand that such compensation may be on a per-trade basis or another basis.<\/p>\n<p>100. Customer understands and agrees that if Customer\u2019s Account with Paramount Treasury Investmentis introduced by an IB, that IB shall have limited access to information regarding Customer\u2019s Paramount Treasury InvestmentAccount, but the IB shall not have the right to enter into any trades on Customer\u2019s Paramount Treasury InvestmentAccount unless authorized by Customer under a power of attorney between Customer and IB granting such IB the right to trade on Customer\u2019s Account.<\/p>\n<p>101. Customer understands and acknowledges that Customer may have only one IB, a party that originally referred Customer to KOT4X.<\/p>\n<p>102. Customer may terminate Customer\u2019s relationship with an IB by providing written notice to KOT4X. Customer understands and acknowledges that Customer cannot be considered the client of any other IB. Should you have any questions regarding the risks of trading, please contact your Account representative.<\/p>\n<p>103. PRIVACY POLICY. Information Collected by KOT4X.

Paramount Treasury InvestmentLtd does not tolerate money laundering and supports the fight against money launderers. Paramount Treasury InvestmentLtd follows the guidelines set by the UK\u2019s Joint Money Laundering Steering Group. The UK is a full member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the intergovernmental body whose purpose is to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. Paramount Treasury InvestmentLtd now has policies in place to deter people from laundering money. These policies include:<\/p>\n<p>156. \u2022 ensuring clients have valid proof of identification<\/p>\n<p>157. \u2022 maintaining records of identification information<\/p>\n<p>158. \u2022 determining that clients are not known or suspected terrorists by checking their names against lists of known or suspected terrorists<\/p>\n<p>159. \u2022 informing clients that the information they provide may be used to verify their identity<\/p>\n<p>160. \u2022 closely following clients\u2019 money transactions<\/p>\n<p>161. \u2022 Not accepting cash, money orders, third-party transactions, exchange houses transfers or Western Union transfers.<\/p>\n<p>162. Money laundering occurs when funds from an illegal\/criminal activity are moved through the financial system in such a way as to make it appear that the funds have come from legitimate sources.<\/p>\n<p>163. Money Laundering usually follows three stages:<\/p>\n<p>164. \u2022 firstly, cash or cash equivalents are placed into the financial system<\/p>\n<p>165. \u2022 secondly, money is transferred or moved to other accounts (e.g. futures accounts) through a series of financial transactions designed to obscure the origin of the money (e.g. executing trades with little or no financial risk or transferring account balances to other accounts)<\/p>\n<p>166. \u2022 And finally, the funds are re-introduced into the economy so that the funds appear to have come from legitimate sources (e.g. closing a futures account and transferring the funds to a bank account).<\/p>\n<p>167. Trading accounts are one vehicle that can be used to launder illicit funds or to hide the true owner of the funds. In particular, a trading account can be used to execute financial transactions that help obscure the origins of the funds.<\/p>\n<p>168. Paramount Treasury InvestmentLtd directs funds withdrawals back to the original source of remittance, as a preventative measure.<\/p>\n<p>169. International Anti-Money Laundering requires financial services institutions to be aware of potential money laundering abuses that could occur in a customer account and implement a compliance program to deter, detect and report potentially suspicious activity.<\/p>\n<p>170. These guidelines have been implemented to protect Paramount Treasury InvestmentLtd and its clients.<\/p>\n<p>171.

We believe that everyone who contacts us has the right to be heard and understood, and also respected.<br \/>\nWe believe that our staff have the same rights, and we must provide a safe working environment for our staff. We must also ensure the efficient and effective operation of our business, so that we can provide a good service to everyone who is using our business.<br \/>\nWe may decide to restrict access to our service where we consider someone\u2019s actions or behaviour are likely to have a negative effect on our staff or our work.<br \/>\nThis policy sets out the kinds of actions and behaviour that may have a negative effect, and what we will do in these circumstances. This policy applies to everyone who interacts or communicates with us, including clients, potential clients, affiliates, and users of our means of communication \u2013 email, chat, and telephone.<br \/>\nWe recognise that some people may have difficulties in expressing themselves or communicating clearly, especially when anxious or upset. We also understand that some people may find it difficult to identify what impact their behaviour might have on other people.<br \/>\nOur rights<br \/>\nAll our staff have the right not to be subjected to aggressive, offensive, or abusive actions, language or behaviour, regardless of the circumstances. This means any actions or behaviour that could cause staff to feel intimidated, threatened or offended. These include, but are not limited to &#8211; threats, physical violence, personal verbal abuse, derogatory remarks, and rudeness, whether made to the member of staff directly or elsewhere. Deliberately provocative or inflammatory statements and unsubstantiated allegations can also amount to abusive actions or behaviour.<br \/>\nViolence can be defined in various ways \u2013 it also includes behaviour or language, whether oral or written, that may cause staff to feel afraid, threatened or abused.<br \/>\nIf someone makes unreasonable demands on us or our staff, or is unreasonably persistent, that may have an impact on our ability to review the person&#8217;s complaint, or the complaints of other people who are using the services. Some examples include the following: requesting responses within an unreasonable timescale; insisting on speaking to or corresponding with a particular member of staff, frequent phone calls, emails, or online chats; repeatedly changing the substance of the complaint or raising unrelated concerns.<br \/>\nExamples of unreasonable persistence include: continual refusal to accept that a decision has been made in relation to a complaint; insisting that we answer questions when we have done so or explained why we will not; persistent refusal to accept explanations relating to what we can or can&#8217;t do; sending emails to multiple members of staff; or repeatedly trying to revisit a case through our internal processes, once those processes have come to an end.<br \/>\nOur approach<br \/>\nWhen we consider that a person&#8217;s actions or behaviour are likely to have a negative effect, we will tell them why and we will give them the opportunity to modify their actions or behaviour. If the actions or behaviour continue, we will take steps to prevent or minimise the negative effects. Wherever possible, we will continue with our review of the person&#8217;s complaint. We will try to ensure that any action we take is the minimum required to protect our staff and to ensure that they can work effectively.<br \/>\nOur staff may either place a caller on hold or end the telephone call if the caller is aggressive, offensive or abusive, or is making unreasonable demands. The same approach will be used for online chats. Staff are accountable for their actions and are required to log all instances of when calls have been terminated, noting the reason(s) for ending the call. All telephone calls and online chats are recorded for service and training purposes.<br \/>\nIt may be necessary to apply restrictions to someone\u2019s contact with us. A decision to do this may be taken by any of our managers. Some of the options that we may consider are:<br \/>\n\u2022 Read and file future emails and chat correspondence but acknowledge or respond to it only if the person is raising new information or making a new complaint,<br \/>\n\u2022 Requesting a person to transfer any funds they own from their account, and subsequently close their account with us. Once the closure of the account has occurred, to restrict or block future contact from a person.<\/p>\n<p>We will record any incidents which lead us to take action under this policy, and what action we have taken to address the issue.<br \/>\nReport the matter to the Police or appropriate governing body, or take legal action. In such cases, we may not give the person prior warning of taking that action.<br \/>\nAnyone who is unhappy with a decision we have made under this policy may submit a complaint to our email. We will consider it in line with our client policies in place at the given time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This Customer Agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d) is entered into by and between Paramount Treasury InvestmentLtd.
